This is the project for my personal web page. 
Development by Juan Espitia for the class "programación con tecnologías web" 
Some of the js and css code is inspired on a template by MarkUps. The license can be found on the repository with the name "template license.txt"

I used Bootstrap for handling the grid and JQuery for a couple animations and draggable lists
